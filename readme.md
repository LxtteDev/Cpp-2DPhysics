### 2D Physics Engine
*17/3/23 - Now*

After finishing most of the player physics for my [platformer project](https://github.com/LxtteDev/Cpp-Platformer), I decided to get side-tracked making a physics engine from scratch. I want to add static bodies, rigid bodies, soft bodies, cloths, and mabey water. Before I get too invested in this project, I wanted to just do the static and rigid bodies before getting back to work on the platformer.
